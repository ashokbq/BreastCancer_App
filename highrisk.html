    <p> Women who have a family history of multiple (three or more) relatives with breast cancer, especially premenopausal or bilateral breast cancer, should be referred to the Hereditary Cancer Program (HCP) of the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) for genetic counseling. </p>
    <p>The family history often includes ovarian cancer. After consultation with a genetic counselor or medical geneticist, a patient will be offered genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 if appropriate. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are very important but relatively uncommon genes that account for 5% to 10% of all breast cancers. </p>
    <p> The counseling includes education regarding basic genetics and risk assessment for an inherited predisposition for breast and ovarian cancer. The risks, benefits, and limitations of genetic testing, including the psychosocial, legal, and ethical implications, are discussed. Women who test positive for a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 have a 70% to 80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 20% to 40% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer. </p>
    <p> A true-negative test occurs only when there is a known mutation in the family and an individual is found to be negative for the family mutation. When a mutation is not found in a family, the result is uninformative. It could be due to a false-negative, as the sensitivity of the testing method is 90% to 95%, or because a mutation exists in an as-yet unidentified breast cancer gene, or because a mutation truly does not exist in that family. </p>
    <p> These families are still at moderate risk for breast cancer, as 30% may have a cluster of breast cancers due to an interaction of multiple factors not attributable to BRCA1 or BRCA2 </p>
    <p> Women who are carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations (and have no prior history of breast or ovarian cancer) can be referred to the Hereditary Cancer Program High-Risk Clinic, where they will be seen every 6 months for a general physical examination that pays particular attention to the breast and regional lymph nodes. 
    </p> <p> These women are taught breast self-examination and encouraged to perform this monthly. Annual mammograms are performed from age 25 or from the age that is 10 years younger than the age of the relative with the earliest breast cancer diagnosis in the family. 
    </p> <p> In addition, we are investigating the use of annual breast ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging as screening modalities in an attempt to increase the early detection rate. </p>
<p>     The latter two investigations are not indicated for screening in the general population, but may be useful in specific clinical scenarios in the diagnostic workup of a suspicious mass.</p>

Managing your breast cancer risk </h1>
</p>
<p> Your physician may refer you to the British Columbia Cancer Agency Hereditary Cancer Program for genetic risk assessment for breast cancer. For women who proceed to genetic testing and are found to have mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (genes known to account for some breast cancers), an intense screening program of annual mammography, breast ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging may be appropriate. Chemoprevention may be discussed as an option. Some women may choose to have both breasts surgically removed to prevent cancer.
