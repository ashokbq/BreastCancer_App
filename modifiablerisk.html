   There is a large body of evidence from both experimental and epidemiological studies which points to a major influence of ovarian hormones on breast cancer risk with the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is related to overall oestrogen exposure.

Age at menarche is an important determinant of subsequent breast cancer risk.  Estimates from a pooled analysis of the results of 21 studies shows that for each additional year age at menarche is postponed, premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer risk decreases by 9% and 4% respectively.  The median age of menarche worldwide is 14 years with a range from 11-18 years and reported average later age of onset in Asian populations compared to the West.  A study in South Indian women showed that the risk of both pre-menopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer decreased with delay of the onset of menarche but not significantly so. Two smaller studies, one of Mumbai women and one of Delhi women also showed no significant association between age of onset of menarche and subsequent breast cancer risk.

Late menopause increases the risk of breast cancer. Women who have undergone the menopause have a lower risk of breast cancer than pre-menopausal women of the same age and childbearing pattern.   Risk increases by almost 3% for each year older at menopause (natural or induced by surgery), so that a women who has the menopause at 55 rather than 45, has approximately 30% higher risk.  The South Indian study showed an increased risk of breast cancer in woman who became menopausal after the age of 50 (RR 1.87 (95% CI 1.26-2.78)) but there is little other published data.

<p>
Child bearing and breast feeding are of importance when considering subsequent breast cancer risk. The younger the woman is when she begins childbearing, the lower her risk of breast cancer. The relative risk of developing breast cancer is estimated to increase by 3% for each year of delay. Childbearing reduces the risk of breast cancer and the higher the number of full-term pregnancies, the greater the protection. The risk of breast cancer reduces by 7% with each full-term pregnancy, and overall women who have had children have a 30% lower risk than nulliparous women
</p>
<p>
Women who breastfeed reduce their risk compared with women who do not breastfeed. The longer a woman breastfeeds, the greater the protection: risk is reduced by 4% for every 12 months of breastfeeding.  There is also evidence that the reduction in risk of breast cancer with childbirth, and higher risk with later age at first full-time birth, may be limited to oestrogen-receptor-positive tumours.  
</p>
<p>
Data from Indian studies are less clear. The largest study in India to examine the relationship between breastfeeding and breast cancer risk has shown mixed results.  Increasing duration of breast feeding was associated with a significantly decreased risk of pre-menopausal breast cancer but no effect was seen in women with postmenopausal breast cancer.  With regard to parity, the researchers observed that as the number of children a woman has increases, the subsequent risk of breast cancer decreases.  Conversely, the Delhi study showed a protective effect of breast feeding of greater than 6 years duration on breast cancer risk but no significant protective effect related to parity and the Mumbai study showed a non-significant protective effect for breast feeding.  These studies are of small sample size and thus probably underpowered to detect significant differences.
</p>
<p>
The data from India overall suggests that the role of known risk factors on the development of breast cancer within the Indian population is unclear and a large multicentre study would be of benefit to try and understand the shifting trends in breast cancer incidence in this population.
