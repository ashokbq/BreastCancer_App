      <h1> Targeted drugs </h1>
      <p>Targeted drug treatments attack specific abnormalities within cancer cells. Targeted drugs approved to treat breast cancer include: </p>
      <p> <b>Trastuzumab (Herceptin).</b> Some breast cancers make excessive amounts of a protein called human growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Trastuzumab targets this protein that helps breast cancer cells grow and survive. If your breast cancer cells make too much HER2, trastuzumab may help block that protein and cause the cancer cells to die. Side effects may include heart damage, headaches and skin rashes. </p>
      <p> <b>Lapatinib (Tykerb).</b> Lapatinib targets the HER2 protein and is approved for use in advanced metastatic breast cancer. Lapatinib is reserved for women who have already tried trastuzumab and their cancer has progressed. Potential side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, mouth sores, skin rashes, and painful hands and feet. </p>
      <p> <b>Bevacizumab (Avastin).</b> Bevacizumab is a drug designed to stop the signals cancer cells use to attract new blood vessels. Without new blood vessels to bring oxygen and nutrients to the tumor, the cancer cells die. Possible side effects include fatigue, high blood pressure, mouth sores, headaches, slow wound healing, blood clots, heart damage, kidney damage, high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. Research suggests that although this medication may help slow the growth of breast cancer, it doesn't appear to increase survival times. For this reason, bevacizumab isn't approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat breast cancer. But doctors may prescribe it for what's known as off-label use. Use of bevacizumab in breast cancer is controversial.
      <p> <b>Side effects of targeted drugs depend on the drug you receive.</b> Targeted drugs can be very expensive and aren't always covered by health insurance. </p>
