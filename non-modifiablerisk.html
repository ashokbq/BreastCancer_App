   <p> The incidence of breast cancer increases with increasing age with 80% of all breast cancer occurring in women over the age of 50 in the UK. The average age of presentation for breast cancer in the Indian population is widely reported to be around 10 years younger compared to the developed world and is the result of the age structure of the Indian population which is a bottom-heavy (predominantly young) pyramid. </p>
    <p> The role of diet in the aetiology of breast cancer remains controversial.  Interest in the role of diet in the aetiology of breast cancer is stimulated by the observation of the lower incidence of breast cancer in Asian populations where intake of animal products is lower than that of western populations.  Worldwide, a large number of individual follow vegetarian diets but in most countries vegetarians comprise only a small proportion of the population. India is a notable exception because a substantial proportion of the population (perhaps as high as 35%) follow a vegetarian diet and have done so for many generations.  Studies to date exploring the relationship of diet and breast cancer incidence and mortality have not demonstrated any difference between vegetarians compared to non-vegetarians. A study specifically examining the effect of vegetarian diet on subsequent risk of breast cancer in British Asian women showed that lifelong vegetarians had a slight reduction in the risk breast cancer development compared to meat eaters but the result did not achieve statistical significance (RR 0.77 (95% CI 0.5-1.2).  Specific studies in India examining this relationship are few and of small size and show inconsistent findings.  An older study of 689 breast cancer patients in Mumbai found no association between vegetarian diet and breast cancer risk  whereas a study in Kerala of 264 women with breast cancer showed an increased risk of breast cancer associated with a non-vegetarian diet (OR 1.82 (95% CI 1.11-2.98)). A large scale case-control study such as this one to investigate the relationship of breast cancer incidence and diet in the Indian population would be of interest. </p>
    <p> The two diet related factors which have been shown to have an effect on breast cancer incidence within western populations are obesity and alcohol intake.  The incidence of breast cancer in obese postmenopausal women is twice that of the non obese and is related to increased levels of circulating oestrogens due to the peripheral aromatisation of oestrogen in adipose tissue whereas obese pre-menopausal women have a 20% reduction in cancer risk.  Increasing body mass index (BMI) is increasingly becoming a concern in many low-resource countries, particularly in urban India with studies reporting an increase in BMI in urban women compared to women living in rural areas.  A large case control study conducted in South India has shown an increased risk of breast cancer in both overweight pre-menopausal (OR 1.33 (95% CI 1.05-1.69)) and post-menopausal women (OR 1.29 (95% CI 1.00-11.66)).  The findings in pre-menopausal women of an increased risk of breast cancer associated with increased BMI is not consistent with western data. </p>
    <p> The Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer in a large collaborative reanalysis of the worldwide data have shown that the relative risk of breast cancer is increased (RR 1.32 (95% CI 1.19-1.45)) in women who reported drinking alcohol compared to women who reported no alcohol intake for an intake of 35-44 g per day alcohol.  Alcohol intake amongst Indian women is traditionally low but with changing lifestyles within the urban population it is possible that alcohol consumption has increased and this may in part contribute to increased breast cancer rates but no recent data are available. </p>
